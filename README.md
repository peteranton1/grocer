This project demonstrates an approach to solving 
the following requirements.

##Step 1: Shopping cart
Building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and
oranges.

<code>
Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.
</code>

Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs
the total cost

<code>
For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => Â£2.05
</code>

##Step 2: Simple offers
The shop decides to introduce two new offers
buy one, get one free on Apples
3 for the price of 2 on Oranges
Update your checkout functions accordingly
